internet-programming-assignment
===============================

A simple website created as part of an Internet Programming assignment.

The requirement was to create a simple website using HTML5, CSS3 and and JavaScript. The homepage was to read as a simple résumé (a bit of an odd request, I thought) and the other three pages were to describe the three technologies being used in the project. I think it came out pretty well given how long it had been since I'd done any web development prior to this, and I enjoiyed the creative aspect of it.
